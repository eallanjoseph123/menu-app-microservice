This project is one of my pet projects. This also gave me a chance to implement any technology that i want to learn like how the basic configurations and design basic microservice architecture.

The project name is menu app and this app can provide basic functionalities where the user can insert,update,delete, and retrieve their data (item/s) CRUD.
